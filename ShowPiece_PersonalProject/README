This is some code that represents the start of a project I was working on. It is very bare bones as it has only recently been started, but is a strong demonstration of my coding capabilites. It includes a basic inventory handling script, as well as a solid grid building system with several test objects.

There is also a UML that demonstrates how the code interacts with eachother, for a playable prototype. (The UML has more than what is in this file)
