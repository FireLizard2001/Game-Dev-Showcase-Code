The game has been named and is no longer in development. Within the Player Input Handler, all code not managing the Key or Engines is by David Khankin.
The Key and Engine handlers are by Chris Cardimen. (This is a prototype version of the project)

The player input handler is not yet finished. It uses the new input system, but the grab/throw as well as crouching has yet to be inplemented.
